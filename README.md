# Assignment_S1.08._Lambdas

## üìÑ Description

This project consists of Java exercises focused on implementing various functionalities using lambda expressions and the Streams API. The exercises are organized across three levels, each designed to enhance understanding of functional programming concepts in Java. All exercises are intended to be executed from the command line, and all commands and project structure have been created using the Linux Debian command line.
