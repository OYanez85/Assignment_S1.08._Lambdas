# Assignment S1.08: Lambdas

This project contains several exercises involving Java lambdas and streams, including filtering lists, printing month names, and reversing strings. The project has been developed and run using Debian Linux commands.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a single directory with several exercises demonstrating the use of lambdas in Java:

Assignment_S1.08._Lambdas/ ├── src │ └── main │ └── java │ └── com │ └── example │ └── lambdas │ ├── LambdaExercise1.java │ ├── LambdaExercise2.java │ ├── LambdaExercise3.java │ ├── LambdaExercise4.java │ ├── LambdaExercise5.java │ ├── LambdaExercise6.java │ ├── LambdaExercise7.java │ └── LambdaExercise8.java └── README.md

## Exercises Overview

### LambdaExercise1
Filters a list of strings to include only those that contain the letter 'o'.

### LambdaExercise2
Filters a list of strings to include only those that contain the letter 'o' and are longer than 5 letters.

### LambdaExercise3
Prints the names of the months of the year.

### LambdaExercise4
Prints the names of the months using method references.

### LambdaExercise5
Demonstrates a functional interface to return the value of Pi.

### LambdaExercise6
Sorts and prints a list of strings by length (shortest to longest).

### LambdaExercise7
Sorts and prints a list of strings by length (longest to shortest).

### LambdaExercise8
Reverses a given string using a functional interface.
